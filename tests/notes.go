([]rune(s))

because the index is defined, if a match is found between runes, the index can be returned as an int.

if a rune in toFind cannot be found, return -1

store whether or not the current match set is a substring, if not return -1

use a boolean to store whether or not you're currently matching

match the first instance of inFind in s string, if not present -1

subStringIsInS needs to be true or false depending on whether or not toFind is a substring of s

storedIndex is the desired return value and needs to be the index of the first instance of toFind in s
